# GCC-Patch-1.0.2
Updated skeletons for Java, Javascript and Python, as well as new README files for each.

Hello all Global Coding Challenge Contestants,

This repository sets out changes that should be made to the skeleton repositories as part of a minor patch regarding answer submission. The repository is split out into three parts:

- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- C#

Each contains an updated skeleton repository for their respective language. In order to successfully submit solutions for the Challenge, please copy and paste the relevant files into your repository. As a guide, each folder is equipped with a README file, detailing the files in that skeleton that have changed as a part of the patch.

The README files also contain a brief guide on how to fill in your solutions for the Challenge, before you submit to our central servers through a simple <code>git push</code>.

If there are any questions, you can get in touch with us using the help page at www.credit-suisse.com/codingchallenge. 

In the meantime, we wish you all the best of luck as you attempt to be crowned the Global Coding Champion!

Kind Regards

GCC Central Team
